Ever got irritated when the songs on Desktop YT (Browser) just ends and you gotta go and replay the video?

Don't worry I got the same problem and came up with this solution that should help you too ðŸš€ðŸ˜‰

This is a chrome extension that allows us to easily play youtube video's on loop! [cause on Desktop Browser YT there is no option ðŸ˜£]

You could use it on Brave and keep the music on without advertisements

To use you just follow the folling steps:
    1. git clone this repo in your terminal:
        git clone https://github.com/anshu2k24/video_loop_youtube.git
    2. Then open your browser
    3. Go to the settings and click on 'extensions' and then on 'manage extensions'
    4. Activate the developer mode.
    5. Then click on load unpacked.
    6. Then just select and upload the cloned folder of this project.

And you are all set ðŸ¥¹ðŸ’˜ just enjoy you music on LOOP!

NOTE :- there will be a blue coloured loop icon added in the video section of the youtube video you are playing.

We could collaborate and go on to update this current version to something way ahead aswell! just email me ðŸ˜œ
